=== Step2: Configure a VPC and EC2 Key Pair
To run the AWS CloudFormation templates in this repository, you must set up an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html[AWS VPC] and an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[EC2 Key Pair]. If these are already created, you can go directly to the next step.

=== Step 3: Configure Amazon Aurora RDS in your VPC
You must set up an https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/details/postgresql-details/[Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL] database in the VPC that is accessible by XL JetPack to store its data. Furthermore, the https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/[Amazon Aurora] instance must be configured with a number of databases.

There are two options to set up an Aurora database.

==== Step 3a: Existing Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL instance
If you already have an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database instance running in your VPC, click the button below to run a CloudFormation template that will provision the necessary databases.

==== Step 3b: Empty VPC
If you have an empty VPC, click the button below to run a CloudFormation template that will set up Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and provision the necessary databases.

=== Step 4: Launch the XL JetPack stack
After you've set up an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html[AWS VPC], an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[EC2 Key Pair], and https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/details/postgresql-details/[Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL], you can blast off with XL JetPack.

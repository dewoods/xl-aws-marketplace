=== Step2: Configure a VPC and EC2 Key Pair
In order to run the AWS CloudFormation templates in this repository you need to have setup an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html[AWS VPC] and http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[EC2 Key Pair]. If these are already created, you can skip directly to the next Step.

=== Step 3: Configure Amazon Aurora RDS in your VPC
Before blasting off with XL JetPack, you need to have an https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/details/postgresql-details/[Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL] database setup in the VPC that is accessible by XL JetPack to store its data. Furthermore this https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/[Amazon Aurora] instance needs to be configured with a number of databases.

In order to achieve this, there are two options:

==== Step 3.a Existing Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL instance
If you already have an existing Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database instance running in your VPC, click the below button to run the CloudFormation template to provision the databases.

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create?stackName=XLJetPack-RDS&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/xl-jetpack-aws/setup-xl-jetpack-rds.yaml[]


==== Step 3.b Empty VPC
If this is an empty VPC, please click the below button to run the CloudFormation template that will setup both Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and provision the necessary databases. 

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create?stackName=XLJetPack-RDS&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/xl-jetpack-aws/create-xl-jetpack-database.yaml[]

=== Step 4: Launch the XL JetPack stack
Once you've setup the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html[AWS VPC] , http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[EC2 Key Pair] and https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/details/postgresql-details/[Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL], you can blast off using XL JetPack.
